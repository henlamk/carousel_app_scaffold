For mocks sake:

This project is going to be the very basis for a couple of apps I am planning to publish. 
The idea behind these apps is simple and based on KaptnCook: three entries a day that the user might like, which results in a solid foundation over time without causing the user any inconvenience by wasting too much time as the usage is natively limited to around 30 seconds a day.

Upcoming to dos: 
- playful transitions in carousel on basis of https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCyoHclCqc8&t=1631s
- clip path designs
